## Exercises

### Point 

Write a class called Point, which represents a point in two-dimensional space. A point has x and y properties, given as arguments to its constructor. 

It also has a single method plus, which takes another point and returns the sum of the two points, that is, a new point whose x is the sum of the x properties of the two original points, and whose y is the sum of their y properties. 

``` js
new Point(1, 2).plus(new Point(2, 1)) // → Point{x: 3, y: 3} 
```

### Speaker and Screamer 

Write two classes, which are called Speaker and Screamer. Speaker is a simple type that exposes a speak method which, when called, logs the given text along with the speaker's name. Shouter is a subtype of Speaker which shouts its text and makes it uppercase. 

You will need to complete this task in ES5 first and then rewrite in ES6. 

``` js
new Speaker("Mr. Calm").speak("easy, man"); 
// → “Mr. Calm says easy, man” 

new Screamer("Mr. Loud").speak("hell yeah"); 
// → “Mr. Loud shouts HELL YEAH” 
```

### The Reading List 

Create a class BookList. Create another class called Book. 

#### BookLists should have the following properties: 

*  Number of books marked as read 
*  Number of books marked not read yet 
*  A reference to the next book to read (book object) 
*  A reference to the current book being read (book object) 
*  A reference to the last book read (book object) 
*  An array of all the Books 

#### Each Book should have several properties: 

*  Title 
*  Genre 
*  Author 
*  Read (true or false) 
*  Read date, can be blank, otherwise needs to be a JS Date() object 

#### Every Book should have a few methods: 

.markAsRead(book) 
*  Should mark the book that is currently being read as "read" 
*  Give it a read date of new Date(Date.now()) 

#### Every Booklist should have a few methods: 

.add(book)
*  Should add a book to the books list. 
*  If it is first one in a list, then it should became current one 

.finishCurrentBook()
*  Change the last book read to be the book that just got finished 
*  Change the current book to be the next book to be read 
*  Change the next book to be read property to be the first unread book you find in the list of books
